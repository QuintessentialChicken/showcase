					Hi, I'm Leon and I'm a Game Developer. I currently study Games Engineering and I'm working on a few projects on my own, which you can check out down below.
					What made me get into developing games was the joy of games themselves and the joy of solving problems. There's nothing more satisfying than making an elegant solution to a complex issue work.
					When I'm not coding I'm probably playing guitar (mostly metal), reading or cooking something delicious. So if you want to jam, have a good book or recipe to share or just want to make some games, hit me up!
