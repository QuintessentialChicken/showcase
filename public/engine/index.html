                    Welcome to my game engine blog. This is a project I started recently to learn more about game development and engine architecture and I will use this page to document my progress.
                    <br><br>
                    Stay tuned to follow me figure out various subsystems like rendering, physics, AI, and more.

					This was probably the hardest step of them all and I'm still not quite done with it. Whenever I start a new project, I tend to get hung up on "doing it right" from the beginning so that
					I don't have to change it later but it results in not making much progress. Since architecture is such a central part though, I allowed myself some more time to gather information.
					I started following a DirectX tutorial by ChiliTomatoNoodle (yes, that's the name) and it got me started initially on DirectX but it wasn't good for architecture. Another resource I can
					recommend is the classic book "Game Engine Architecture" by Jason Gregory. It gives great insights on a lot of aspects of an engine but again, it was hard to develop an idea for how 
					everything works together.
					<br><br>
					What really had the biggest impact for me was getting my hands on the source code of an actual successful engine, written in C++ and with DirectX. I spent days on end combing through
					the code, peeling back the abstraction layers, finding out where the damn thing's entry point even was. But once I got used to it, I used it constantly to check their way of doing it.
					<br><br>
					The first big question mark I had was when I found that the reference engine used almost exclusively static functions and global variables in all the startup parts of the engine. Here I was
					after years of university where object-oriented programming was the center of the universe looking at code, that was (almost) entirely without it. I checked the book again and it actually 
					recommended that exact approach so that's what I went with.
