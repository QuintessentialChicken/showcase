This is an implementation of the classic Scrabble game based on JavaScript and NodeJs. It enables playing over the internet with friends.

## Motivation

During the pandemic it has been difficult to meet up with friends to play board games. A workaround is to do these sessions online but we
soon noticed that there aren't any viable options to play Scrabble. So we built one ourselves...

## Frontend

The frontend is build in classic HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It's kept simple yet offers all the functionality in a clear way.
The underlying structure is provided by a grid into which the components such as the letters, the board, the chat and the 
controls are placed into.

## Backend

The backend is provided by a NodeJs server. It waits for connections, notifies the players for changes and game events and enables 
communication between the players via the chat.
